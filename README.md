# GBRSA Jump Rope Judge App ‚Äî *Light + Fast*

## üìñ Overview
This is a **web-based judging and scoring system** for jump rope competitions.  
It is designed to be **simple, fast, and reliable** so judges can focus on the athletes, not the software.  

The app runs as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, connected to **Google Sheets** for live data.  
- **Frontend**: Lightweight HTML/JS/CSS (runs in browser, works well on tablets/phones).  
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script Web App (fetches competitor data, handles login, and saves results).  

---

## üîê Login System (NEW)
- Judges must log in using **UserID + Password** before accessing the dashboard.  
- Credentials are stored in a **separate secure Google Sheet** (`Users` tab).  
- Each user has:
  - `UserID`
  - `Password`
  - `Role` (Judge/Admin)
  - `Active` (TRUE/FALSE to enable/disable login)

### How Login Works
1. Judge opens `login.html`.  
2. Enters **UserID** + **Password**.  
3. App sends request to backend with `{ action: "login", UserID, Password }`.  
4. Backend checks the Users sheet.  
   - If valid ‚Üí returns success + role.  
   - If invalid/inactive ‚Üí login denied.  
5. On success, session is stored in `localStorage`.  
6. Judges are redirected to `index.html` (dashboard).  
7. All main pages (`index.html`, `speed.html`, `freestyle.html`) are **protected** ‚Äî if not logged in, user is redirected back to `login.html`.

### Frontend (Netlify)
1. Deploy the `frontend/` folder to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (or any static host).  
2. Update `config.js` with your deployed **Web App URL**. Example:

```javascript
const BACKEND_URL = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx12345abcde/exec";
